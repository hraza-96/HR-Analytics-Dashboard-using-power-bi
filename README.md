# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-using-power-bi

This HR Analytics Dashboard is one of my latest projects. It highlights key metrics like attrition rate, age distribution, salary brackets, and job roles, helping HR teams gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions. 📈 This course has really enhanced my data visualization skills and shown me the power of interactive dashboards.

A big thank you to Rishab Mishra for the invaluable guidance and support. Looking forward to applying these new skills to more data challenges!
